# Process HID Data Like A Pro

## HTB Forensics Challenge 
### LOGGER

In today's world, we are surrounded by a sea of digital devices, each with their own unique HID data. HID, or Human Interface Device, data includes input from devices like keyboards, mice, and game controllers, and is crucial for incident responders to understand in order to quickly identify potential threats.

As an incident responder, our role is to navigate this sea of data and quickly identify and respond to any incidents that may arise. In this HTB challenge, we will take on the role of an incident responder and go step-by-step through the process of handling HID data like a pro, from capturing and analyzing HID data, to identifying potential threats and responding to incidents.


This simple script was built to convert HID data (hex) to ascii as a POC / foundation to you building your own script.
